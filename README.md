# Visu-Layout
Visu-Layout is a collection of predefined layout templates for Beckhoff TwinCAT TF1800/TF1810 HMI. The goal of this project is to provide reusable, consistent screen layouts (navigation bars, content areas, dialogs, etc.) so you can focus on your machine logic and visualization design instead of rebuilding the same basic structure in every new project.
